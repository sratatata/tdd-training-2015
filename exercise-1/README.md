Create a function taking a positive integer as its parameter and returning a string containing the Roman Numeral representation of that integer.

Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit separately,
starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero.

In Roman numerals 1990 is rendered: 1000=M, 900=CM, 90=XC; resulting in MCMXC.
2008 is written as 2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII. 

Remember about few exceptions like 4,
which is written as IV with descending order.

1666 uses each Roman symbol in ascending order: MDCLXVI.
3469 = MMMCDLXIX
